helix-config
============

These are my config files for the [Helix editor][helix], including a port of
one of my color schemes to it. Most of the custom key mappings are intended to
make Helix work a little more like Kakoune selection-wise, but not in a way that
should be immediately confusing to anyone. It also replaces any C-s mappings
since I used those in tmux.
